        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a BYU student who likes reading, listening to podcasts about frogs, eating quesadillas
          and knitting simple patterns. Currently studying computer science and exploring miscellaneous interests, 
          such as writing and Japanese. In my spare time I like to play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          My aim is to create organizational apps that are versatile and easy to use. I want to help people
          have greater access to their ideas.

          <p>Fun Facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most frogs are not French. This is because frogs exist throughout the world, and most of the world is not France.
              This fact is fun to everyone who does not like baguettes and disappointing to everyone else. If you are one of the lucky baguette-haters, 
              congratulations! I hope you had fun.
            </li>
            <li>The plus sign was not invented by anyone in particular but was an evolution of a Latin abbreviation used for the same purpose. 
              Nowadays this useful little symbol pops up in all sorts of ways. This infomation is sourced from 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs">Wikipedia</a>, and I encourage you to take this chance to go down a research rabbit hole of your choosing.
            </li>
            <li>I once built a 72 cm skyscraper out of popsicle sticks, complete with furniture. I have used this as my default personal fun fact
              since high school, and I don't see why I should stop now. (Hot glue is quite hot, by the way. If you make an attempt of your own, please be careful.)
